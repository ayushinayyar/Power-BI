# Power-BI
Analyzed e-commerce sales data creating a interactive dashboard using Power BI.
Developed an interactive dashboard to monitor and evaluate online sales data. Used sophisticated parameters to customise worksheets by applying filters and slicers. Made connections, joined new tables, performed computations to work with data, and enabled user-specified parameters for visuals. Made use of many customised visualisation types, such as maps, slices, bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, and area charts.
